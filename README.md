# pocketninjadesign
Repo for my porfolio website which in itself is a portfolio entry using the following tech:

1. Gulp
   * gulp-twig
2. Webpack / Babel / ES6
   * axios
3. jQuery
4. Greensock

## Gulp

Currently used for templating and pushing files to my xampp for testing with PHP

## Webpack / Babel / ES6

Used for generating all of the lovely code

## jQuery

For beautiful DOM manipulation of things like the peekaboo code which personally I still have no answers for in React implementation.  Anybody please feel free to show me the light but stack overflow fails as they just say you're thinking about it all wrong because you're using jQuery

## Greensock

Never used it before but it worked out very nicely for the basic slide in of the peekaboo code and has it's own callback / promises so I don't need to use the Animate start finished methods I created.

My next project will be animating the logo which in flash would be very easy but in the world of none flash the world of aching (balls / overies) prevails.
