Repo for my porfolio website which in itself is a portfolio entry using the following tech:

1. Gulp
   * gulp-twig
2. Webpack / Babel / ES6
   * axios
3. jqlite
4. Greensock

## Gulp

Currently used for templating and pushing files to my xampp for testing with PHP

## Webpack / Babel / ES6

Used for generating all of the lovely code

## jqlite

Just need that connection with jQuery mannnnnnn :-P

## Greensock

Never used it before but it worked out very nicely for the basic slide in of the peekaboo code and has it's own callback / promises so I don't need to use the Animate start finished methods I created.

My next project will be animating the logo which in flash would be very easy but in the world of none flash the world of aching (balls / overies) prevails.
